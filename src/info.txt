src7

Combines thing.cpp and main.cpp [no longer true]

Uses getopt()

Splits functions up among several folders for the sake of readability. Also
includes a lot more documentation.

Tested with bowtie2 alignment for ecoli and compared against kallisto output.
Few entries are exactly the same but are generally similar (i.e. if one class
has a count of ~200 then both outputs indicate something around that).

TODO: test with hisat2 for a few mouse reads, then test with entire genome.

TODO: document

TODO: optimize some things? specifically kallisto functions, since those weren't
written with runtime speed in mind

ALL OF THIS INFORMATION IS OUTDATED. JUST LOOK AT YOUR GITHUB COMMIT MESSAGES.
